🐍 Python Basics Practice

This is a collection of small Python code snippets I wrote while learning foundational concepts:

- String methods and slicing
- List indexing, appending, popping
- Tuples and immutability
- Set operations

It includes code experimentation and method usage — the building blocks for all Python data projects.
